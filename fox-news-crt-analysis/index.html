            <p>Fox News has mentioned critical race theory nearly every day since the middle of March. 
                That’s more than 200 days of virtually non-stop coverage of a term that up 
                until recently was mainly restricted to academia, and to this day is not 
                so well known among <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-half-of-voters-are-unfamiliar-with-critical-race-theory" target="_blank">most Americans.</a></p> 

            <p>Nevertheless, this term or its acronym “CRT” is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-02/how-critical-race-theory-became-a-political-target-quicktake" target="_blank">present frequently</a> in the news today. 
                Parents have <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2021/06/02/ri-school-board-may-sue-woman-over-critical-race-theory-public-record-requests/7506535002/" target="_blank">filed public record requests</a>, fearful and angry that their childrens’ 
                schools might be teaching a theory they consider racist and harmful. 
                Legislators have written and <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-assembly-passes-ban-on-teaching-critical-race-theory/article_1e53044a-8047-58c7-9560-368ae54fb588.html" target="_blank">voted on bills</a> that would ban the term from classrooms, 
                while some teachers have <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2021-10-20/federal-lawsuit-poses-first-challenge-to-ban-on-teaching-critical-race-theory" target="_blank">filed federal lawsuits</a> to fight those bans. 
                A <a href="https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard" target="_blank">global event research project</a> has recorded over 100 demonstrations for and against critical 
                race theory all over the U.S. since February, many led by conservative groups 
                and teachers unions.</p>
            
            <h3>So, how did we get here?</h3>
            <p>Critical race theory was most often taught in law schools, says Peggy McIntosh, 
                a scholar who <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-origins-of-privilege" target="_blank">popularized the term “white privilege”.</a>  Its foundations date back 
                to the 1970s, when law professors began exploring how race and racism have 
                shaped American law and society. <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/civil-rights-reimagining-policing/a-lesson-on-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank">The theory</a> rests on the premise that racial 
                bias—intentional or not—is baked into U.S. laws and institutions.</p>
            
            <p>"To understand it requires extended study. Almost nobody writing about CRT in 
                social media knows what it is, and what it does and doesn't do.  
                I do not enter that fray [...]. I do encourage journalists not to conflate 
                fighting about CRT with the actual content of CRT." —Peggy McIntosh</p>
            
            <p>The public’s definition of critical race theory has undergone a transformation 
                from a legal theory to a catch-all term for everything dealing with systemic 
                racism and equality in America. It started with a subtle shift in the definition 
                of critical race theory—from a framework for identifying racism in institutions 
                to an attempt to label a person, <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200711_000000_Tucker_Carlson_Tonight/start/557/end/592#" target="_blank">even a child,</a>
                 as inherently racist. <a href="https://americarenewing.com/issues/list-critical-race-theory-buzzwords/" target="_blank">Broad terms</a> like 'equity', 'diversity and inclusion' or 'cultural awareness' 
                have now also been equated with CRT by some Fox News anchors, elected officials 
                and everyday citizens.</p>
            
           <h3>How did the phrase critical race theory become a common talking point?</h3>
            <p>An analysis of television and online news coverage shows that Fox News 
                repeatedly mentioned critical race theory for months before other major 
                news outlets uttered word of the topic. Since May 2020, Fox News mentioned 
                CRT over five times more than CNN and MSNBC and published 1,060 articles about it, 
                the most out of any major news outlet, according to television news
                transcripts from the Internet TV News Archive using GDELT and articles
                 in the MediaCloud database. Popular shows, FOX and Friends and 
                 The Ingraham Angle have talked about critical race theory over 500 and 
                 300 times respectively.</p>
            
            <p>Their coverage has frequently propagated fear-inducing claims 
                that schools have been shaming, brainwashing and ultimately 
                harming children across the nation.</p>

            <h3>Where do we start? May 2020 — November 2020</h3>
                <p>In the weeks following George Floyd’s murder on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/derek-chauvin-trial-timeline-ad67932d2bf727dd4c23e17e63a97224" target="_blank">May 25</a> last year, 
                Black Lives Matter protests gained nationwide support and 
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/books/antiracism-books-race-racism.html" target="_blank">anti-racism book sales surged.</a> Protestors <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/confederate-statues-removed-george-floyd-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">toppled confederate statues.</a></p> 
                
                <p>And just a couple of weeks later critical race theory was introduced 
                onto the Fox News mainstage by one of its hosts—Laura Ingraham. In a <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200611_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/240/end/300" target="_blank">monologue on 
                June 10,</a> she reflects upon the events of the past several weeks saying, 
                “what we are witnessing is a relentless propaganda war against the old 
                teachings about America.”  The banner beneath her changed from
                “Left Destroying Our Culture” to “Liberals Surrender America.”</p>
                <img class="left" src="img/crt-3.png" style="width:400px;"/>
                <p>Ingraham went on to say that in years past, Republicans and Democrats 
                had dismissed the academic concept of critical race theory.</p>
                
                <p>“Today those theories are mainstream,” she said. “I think what we’re 
                seeing now from the left is the result of, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200611_060000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/1893/end/1928#">I think it’s just decades
                of critical race theory</a> [and] grievance studies infecting our schools 
                and our culture.”</p>
                <img class="left" src="img/crt-4.png" style="width:400px;"/>
                <p>While Ingraham had claimed critical race theory was mainstream, 
                Fox had mentioned the phrase only a handful of times in the several years prior. Ingraham’s segment 
                was part of the beginning of what would become a steady stream of critical 
                race theory coverage on Fox. From July 8 through July 28 of 2020, 
                Ingram and Tucker Carlson hosted four different experts who
                 discussed how “critical race theory is <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200724_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/3111/end/3146#">incredibly pervasive</a> in the 
                 American education system” and that “ideological extremism [was] <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200709_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/693/end/728#">infiltrating 
                 and indoctrinating our children.”</a></p>
                <p>One of those experts was self-proclaimed investigative journalist <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200729_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/1560/end/1620">Chris Rufo,</a> 
                who has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory">taken credit</a> for starting the national critical race theory debate. 
                After two appearances on the Ingraham Angle in July, Rufo went on to appear 
                on Fox regularly as a go-to expert about how critical race theory was <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200814_000000_Tucker_Carlson_Tonight/start/2241/end/2276#">"spreading 
                like wildfire”</a> through American institutions. Rufo declared himself to be in a 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chris-rufo-one-man-war-race-theory">“one-man war against critical race theory”</a> on Tucker Carlson in mid-August.</p>

            </div>
           <div class="text-container">
            <p>Just a few days after that appearance, President Trump and Russ Vought, the Director
                 of the Office of Management and Budget, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/M-20-34.pdf">issued a memorandum</a> ordering government 
                 agencies to stop conducting diversity trainings.</p>

                <p>In early September, after Rufo’s first four CRT-related appearances on Fox, 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1302778830055182337?s=20">he tweeted</a> out a poll, asking whether his audience wanted his next investigation
                 to “look at critical race theory in: K-12 education, corporations or U.S. military.” 
                 Respondents voted overwhelmingly in favor of K-12 education.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
            <p>About 15 weeks later, Rufo <a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/17/indoctrinating-an-entire-school-system-in-pc-racism/">published an article</a> called “Indoctrinating an entire school 
                system in PC racism,” that discussed a “racially charged training that convicted 
                US schools of committing ‘spirit murdering.’”  Rufo appeared on <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20201222_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/2880/end/2940">The Ingraham Angle</a>
                 a few days later to discuss the article. The introductory chyron reads, 
                “Indoctrinating our Children.”</p>
            <h3>CNN & MSNBC Go Dark: December 2020 - April 2021</h3>
            <p>In the four months from December 2020 through April 2021, while the country was 
                focused on the contested results of the election, the inauguration, and the first 
                months of the Biden administration, CNN and MSNBC had virtually nothing to say 
                about critical race theory.</p> 

            <p>In those 151 days, MSNBC covered the topic for a total of four days. CNN covered it once. Fox News
                mentioned critical race theory on its airwaves for a total of 78 days.</p> 

            <p>Simultaneously, legislators in at least 20 different states started introducing bills. 
                Many were copycats of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/28/2020-21534/combating-race-and-sex-stereotyping">Trump’s Executive Order</a> opposing the use of <a target="_blank" href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2021/pdf/SR/SR0056IN.pdf">“race or sex 
                stereotyping or scapegoating.”</a> Others explicitly prohibited teaching the <a target="_blank" href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/22266/214787">1619 
                Project</a> and other materials “associated with efforts to reframe this country's 
                history in a way that promotes racial divisiveness.”</p>

            <p>During that time Fox hosts and guests said that “critical race theory is in <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210215_010000_Life_Liberty__Levin/start/2593/end/2628#">every school 
                system in the country.”</a></p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Rufo appeared on Fox nine times from December through April and all but two of those
                 segments described critical race theory as infiltrating classrooms. In those segments 
                 Laura Ingraham said schools were <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210225_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle#start/2895/end/2930">“poisoning four- and five-year-olds”</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210115_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/1440/end/1500">“brainwashing 
                 our children.”</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210115_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/1560/end/1620">Rufo described</a> how a social identity lesson in a third-grade classroom 
                 reminded one Chinese mother of the Cultural Revolution which “led to the deaths of millions.”</p>

            <p>“These lessons terrify her to her core,” he said.</p>

            <p>Ingraham and Rufo made the <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210227_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/1104/end/1139#">same connection</a> a month later saying, “what we’re seeing here 
                in the United States is a similar effort.” Several times critical race theory was
                 juxtaposed with <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210120_010000_Tucker_Carlson_Tonight/start/2400/end/2460">communism</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210321_190000_Sunday_Morning_Futures_With_Maria_Bartiromo/start/2345/end/2380#">China</a>, with one guest saying the government was 
                 trying to use critical race theory to divide people against each other, 
                 undermine parental authority and ultimately <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210116_110000_FOX_and_Friends_Saturday/start/9908/end/9943#">“abuse”</a> children.</p>

            <p>Laura Ingraham called critical race theory a tool “teachers, school board members, 
                [and] consultants are using to <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210318_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/650/end/685#">turn children against their parents.”</a> Candace Owens 
                said she thought, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210316_000000_Tucker_Carlson_Tonight#start/1810/end/1845">“parents should be terrified.”</a></p>

            <img class="left" src="img/crt-8.png" style="width:500px;"/>
            

            <p>Transcripts of Fox News broadcast coverage from May 2020 through April 2021 showed 
                that the words most commonly used with the term “critical race theory” shifted. From May 
                through November, “federal” and “training” were each mentioned in nearly 
                20 percent of all clips containing “critical race theory.” From December through
                 April the top words included “school(s)” and “parents.”</p>
           
            <p>As mentions of critical race theory increased on Fox, so did mentions of “indoctrination.”
                 The term was often used in discussions of progressive ideology being taught in schools;
                  Fox News hosts and commentators repeatedly instructed viewers to <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210318_160000_Outnumbered/start/327/end/362#">“take a stand”</a> and
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210420_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/764/end/799#">“push back.”</a> Laura Ingraham, in a <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210318_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle#start/432/end/467">mid-March segment</a> encouraged parents to not just show up at 
                    school board meetings but to start running for the seats.</p>
                
                <p>“Parents have to do more than just post on social media and talk amongst themselves 
                about it,” she said. “They must start to form mass movements to take back our education 
                system.”</p>

            <p>From May to early August this year, the exposure on Fox about CRT steadily rose both on
                television and online. Mentions of the term critical race theory in broadcasts more 
                than doubled from the month before. Fox News mentioned CRT over 700 times in May 
                compared to CNN’s 70 and MSNBC’s 90. In their coverage, Fox started featuring school 
                board meetings, highlighting tensions between parents and teachers and the alleged 
                indoctrination of children.</p>

    <p>“All over the country beginning last June school curricula have changed completely and become 
        explicitly political and openly racist,” <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjnpjJnb9E">claimed Tucker Carlson</a> on his May 18 broadcast, “and 
        most parents have just sat there on their hands and watched it happen and watched their kids 
        hurt by it.”</p>

    <p>He then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjnpjJnb9E">featured a mother</a> whose speech against CRT at a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/iandprior/status/1392292044975087617">school committee meeting</a> 
        in Loudoun County, Virginia, had gone viral on Twitter a few days before. In one of the most 
        violent segments we reviewed, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210525_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/3000/end/3060">Laura Ingraham cited</a> an “explosive exposé” by Rufo 
        claiming public schools in Portland were raising "child soldiers." She subsequently 
        played a graphic video of someone pushing a white man down on the ground and a supposed 
        14-year-old kicking him in the face. The video showed the man’s bloody face and someone
         saying "knocked this motherf***er out" and “Black lives matter you, f*****!”</p>

    <p>Ingraham then introduced a smiling Rufo and asked, “why should every American be concerned
         across the country about the indoctrination going on in the schools there?” Rufo responded 
         saying that Portland schools had adopted, “the pedagogy of the oppressed.” 
         Simultaneously, a video played next to him showing two men wearing helmets, 
         safety vests and combat boots walk in a street shrouded in smoke and explosions.</p>

    <p>In May, 15 different protests against CRT cropped up in 12 US states. In Georgia, 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajc.com/education/opposition-to-critical-race-theory-intensifies-in-georgia/FKXKJELVIBHX3KCWZLVDQNWAAY/">hundreds gathered outside</a> of a school board meeting in Craven County to protest 
        critical race theory in schools, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
         As a result the board reportedly halted its plans to implement a “diversity, 
         equity and inclusion” program.</p>

    <p>In June, Fox’s written coverage reached its peak, totaling 275 articles published 
        that mention critical race theory, and on television the phrase was mentioned 
        over 1,200 times. Over 50 protests took place in 25 different states that month, 
        according to ACLED. Nearly half favored CRT. North Carolina alone saw six total 
        demonstrations on both sides of the debate. In New Hampshire there were five. </p>
   
    <p>Meanwhile, the Center for Renewing America, a right-leaning organization led by 
        Russ Vought, released a template for bills <a target="_blank" href="https://citizensrenewingamerica.com/issues/model-school-board-language-to-prohibit-critical-race-theory-2/">“to prohibit CRT”</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://citizensrenewingamerica.com/issues/combatting-critical-race-theory-in-your-community/">a toolkit</a> for
         “combatting critical race theory”  including a <a target="_blank" href="https://americarenewing.com/issues/list-critical-race-theory-buzzwords/">list of 86 “buzzwords”</a> to help 
         parents identify critical race theory. Some legislators used this list in bills 
         <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lc/hearing_testimony_and_materials/2021/ab411/ab0411_2021_08_11.pdf">banning anti-racism training</a> for teachers.</p> 

    <p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/06/17/americans-opinion-critical-race-theory">YouGov poll</a> conducted in the middle of June estimated that only a third of Democrats
         self-reported having a good idea of what critical race theory is compared to 
         41% of Republicans. Of the Democrats who said they were aware of CRT, 28% had a
          favorable opinion. In comparison, only 2% of Republicans familiar with critical 
          race theory were in favor of it.</p>

        <h3>Competing Networks Cover CRT</h3>
        <p>As protests and legal action escalated during the summer months, competing networks CNN 
            and MSNBC dramatically increased their coverage, though the networks still did not 
            mention the term as often as Fox. CNN and MSNBC used airtime to try to debunk the 
            statements made by Fox. For instance, on June 28 Joy Reid hosted the historian 
            Ibram X. Kendi and author of “How to Be an Antiracist.” <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20210628_230000_The_ReidOut#start/2748/end/2783">In the segment</a> of 
            “The Reid Out,” she asked Kendi direct questions like if he believed 
            "white Americans are inherently racist,"—a phrase repeatedly used by
             Fox to define the tenets of critical race theory—or if he knew of
             "any school teaching that white Americans are inherently racist.” 
             Kendi’s response was a blank "no.”
            </p>
        <p>In the summer, coverage surrounding CRT started to extensively focus on education. 
            Across right-leaning media outlets, the topic of critical race theory became more 
            common following many months of limited coverage. Previously, it was only mentioned 
            on rare occasions, according to an analysis of online media coverage using MediaCloud. 
            Fox News’ written coverage grew significantly in June, reaching a peak of 275 articles 
            published that mentioned “critical race theory” at least in one sentence— 60% more 
            than its closest competitor of the Daily Caller with 110 stories.

        <p>From the peak of activity during June and early July, the frequency of broadcast coverage, 
            protests, and government actions relating to CRT declined leading into the back-to-school
             period in late August.</p>

        <h3>September 2021 — Present: Schools grapple with parents concerns and new legislation</h3>

        <p>In recent weeks, critical race theory coverage was revived by the networks as parents 
        demanded to know what schools were teaching their children as they headed back to school. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2021&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=B&billNbr=1332&pn=1430">A bill 
        was introduced</a> into the Pennsylvania General Assembly requiring all public school curriculums 
        be uploaded to a publicly available website. Similarly, a bill named the <a target="_blank" href="https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22LSO-0137-WD-0.3.pdf">“Civics Transparency Act”</a> 
        was drafted for the Wyoming Senate.</p>

        <p>“We've had a hard time kind of combating and defining what [critical race theory] is and what
         it is not,” says Tom Hosler, superintendent of Perrysburg Exempted Village School District. 
         Hosler says parents have been filing dozens of public records requests, asking for any 
         documentation containing a broad array of terms, like “equity” or “social justice.” 
         <a target="_blank" href="https://casel.org/about-us/our-history/">“Social Emotional Learning”</a> is also on the list of CRT-related words being circulated. 
         It’s a decades-old framework for aiding childhood social and emotional development. 
         Hosler says he and his staff have to find new ways to refer to programs like this one, 
         because the words are triggering so much fear and anger.</p>       

         <p>“Critical race theory becomes this catch-all phrase for everything that might be threatening to 
        them or things they are not comfortable with,” he says. Hosler says that some parents are 
        trying to opt their children out of lessons like these.</p>

        <p>Fox News commentators have even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/time-to-pull-your-kids-out-of-public-school">rallied parents</a> to pull their children out of public school altogether. 
        Candace Owens warned parents at the beginning of October that they needed to act quickly and remove 
        their kids from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/candace-owens-sounds-off-on-biden-admin-targeting-outspoken-parents-over-public-school-controversies-time-is">“indoctrination camps.”</a> Tensions have grown in school districts around the country,
        so much so that in early October, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1438986/download">Attorney General Merrick Garland directed</a> the FBI and other 
        Department of Justice departments to investigate threats of violence and harassment of school 
        officials and board members.</p>

        <p>In response, Chris Rufo <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-634580066208">falsely described</a> the National School Boards Association (NSBA)’s 
        request for assistance as “classifying protests as ‘domestic terrorism’” in a tweet. 
        Fox and other <a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/22/national-school-boards-association-disavows-letter-that-led-to-fbi-parent-crackdown/">right-wing media outlets</a> launched a campaign referred to as an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/department-of-justice-garland-school-boards-crt-threats">"FBI crackdown"</a>
         and interviewed parents who labeled themselves “Domestic Terrorist” on social media.</p> 

        <p>Critical race theory has even become a talking point in the November <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/us/politics/virginia-governor-republicans-schools.html">Virginia Governor’s 
        race</a> as opponents traded advertisements discussing issues of race in education. Glenn Youngkin, 
        the Republican candidate, held a “Parents Matter Rally” on October 13th. </p>


       <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>The critical race theory debate in the U.S. has been a matter of definitions: defining a 
        person’s identity, defining American history, defining the phrase itself. Fox News was the 
        first network to focus its attention on identifying and redefining critical race theory 
        for its audience. In the year-and-a-half since the conversation started, the organization 
        published about and discussed this topic more than any other news organization.</p>

        <p>From a media perspective, today the phrase has become commonplace on many different 
            networks and publications. Dozens of protests have taken place in nearly 70 cities 
            across the U.S.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2681240205455108/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&multi_permalinks=3094625357449922">Thousands of parents</a> are worried about what their children are 
            being taught. Over seventy pieces of legislation have been crafted that seek to 
            define what children should or shouldn't be exposed to in schools. And now that school 
            boards across the country have seats up for election on Nov. 2, the debate could even 
            define the agendas of school leadership nationwide.</p>
